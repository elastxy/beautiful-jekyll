> This Blog is targeted to developers and software users interested in distributed computing and genetic algorithms, more specifically interested in knowing ElastXY projects evolutions, news and anticipations.

### Projects

**ElastXY** is a collection of projects for developing **Distributed Genetic Algorithm** Java applications.

Beyond main project **ElastXY Framework**, side-projects and applications showcasing framework will also be notified here, when available.

This Blog is the entry point of ElastXY projects, hosting author's posts and links to useful materials for applying ElastXY to your projects, or **collaborating by forking on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastxy)** (something I would be very pleased).


### Current interests

Currently, in my free time while developing ElastXY I'm studying distributed computing technologies (Apache Spark, Cassandra, Kafka, Mesos), Scala language, DevOps technologies.

Next, I'd like to study more Reactive Manifesto and related techniques, which I'll apply to ElastXY showcase site, in my intentions to be built with Play Framework and AKKA.

### Personal bio

My name is Gabriele Rossi and I'm the author of ElastXY projects, which I started after being exposed to SMACK stack (and to my wife kisses, see [first post]({% post_url 2018-02-17-elastxy-taking-off %})).

I'm a passionate software engineer and from time to time Scrum Master, Project Manager, DevOps.
Beyond roles and assignments, I like to see healthy projects and organizations, and collaborate with motivated people to build high-performing Teams (mainly Agile).

I worked from 2001 for many software companies, teaching Java at Sun Microsystems and working on Advanced Analytics platform at Accenture Digital amongst the others. Now I'm Scrum Master at ObjectWay Finance building solutions for finance firms.
