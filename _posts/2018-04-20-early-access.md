After 4 weeks, when everything happened (outside of the project, of course), I'm proud and thrilled to announce that the very first version of the Framework is finally available for internal tests.

The version is **0.1.0-SNAPSHOT** as semantic versioning suggests.

At this stage, I'm happy enough if links work and tutorials are easy to read and useful... with internal tests performed by me and my cousin, I suppose, so I kindly ask not to open issues until initial startup problems are corrected.

So, I'm sure I'm going to fix a lot of minor issues for making it stable after this startup period, and I'm confident this first version will become a little more usable in days.

Stay tuned!
